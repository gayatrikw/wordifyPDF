Abstract– The study aims to use machine learning (ML) 
classifiers to identify whether an image is taken in a rural 
or urban area. The proposed system is built using 
supervised learning techniques, where a labelled dataset of 
images is used to train the machine learning classifiers. The 
system uses a combination of feature extraction and 
classification algorithms to accurately classify images as 
rural or urban. The proposed system used BRISK feature 
description technique. These descriptive features would 
then be fed into several machine learning (ML) classifiers, 
such as Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), 
Decision Tree, Logistics Regression and Support Vector 
Machines (SVM) to perform classification. Random Forest 
provides high accuracy as 99.82% when the number of 
clusters K is 3. The proposed system has practical 
applications in many fields such as environmental 
monitoring, land-usage planning, and disaster response. By 
accurately identifying rural and urban surroundings, the 
system can provide critical information for policy makers 
and researchers to make informed decisions about land 
usage and resource allocation.

INTRODUCTION 
      Recent years have seen the quick development of computer 
vision algorithms and it is now possible because of technology 
for remote sensing to automatically differentiate between rural 
and urban areas with high accuracy and efficiency. This has 
wide-ranging practical applications, such as land-usage 
planning, environmental monitoring, disaster solution, and 
public health. 
This paper reviews the traditional feature-based methods used 
for rural-urban identification, which have several limitations, 
including low accuracy and time-consuming processing. Then 
it introduces machine learning methods, which have been 
shown to provide higher accuracies and faster processing times. 
We look at the difficulties and possibilities facing this study 
area, including the requirement for extensive and varied 
datasets, the interpretability of models, and the ethical issues 
surrounding the application of such technology. 
Machine learning algorithm’s advancement has brought up new 
prospects for automatic and efficient rural-urban classification. 
Machine learning algorithms can learn from large amounts of 
labelled data and extract features automatically, making them 
highly efficient and accurate for identifying rural and urban 
environments. This study gives a summary of the state-of-the-
art machine learning classifiers for rural-urban categorization 
based on photos from remote sensing.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
This paper is a review of the research trends in the field of 
evaluation of an city area using google map images. The 
authors summarize the main methods used to analyze street 
view images, including computer vision techniques, deep 
learning algorithms, and geographical information systems 
(GIS). They also highlight the challenges and limitations of 
using pictures from street view of cities regions assessment and 
provide suggestions for future research[1]. 
This study introduces a novel method for identifying land uses 
based on gray-level vector reduction and frequency-based 
contextual categorization. The authors' goal is to improve land-
use categorization's accuracy by incorporating contextual 
information and reducing the size of the input data. The method 
uses frequency-based contextual analysis to extract relevant 
information from the input data, followed by a gray-level vector 
reduction to simplify the data. The reduced data is then used to 
train a machine learning approach for. The authors demonstrate 
that their method is more accurate and effective when the 
findings are contrasted with those from other cutting-edge land-
use identification techniques. The study analyses the 
significance of this findings for future land-use identification 
studies[2]. 
A deep learning strategy for recognising metropolitan regions 
from remote sensing photos is presented in this study. The 
authors' objective is to use deep learning algorithms to improve 
the precision and efficacy of urban area identification. The 
suggested technique analyses the attributes of remote sensing 
photos and identifies metropolitan regions based on patterns 
and characteristics in the data using a deep neural network. 
When compared to other cutting-edge techniques, the method's 
results are evaluated, and the authors show that their method is 
more accurate and efficient. The paper concludes with an 
explanation of how this work may be interpreted for future 
study in the field of urban area identification using remote 
sensing images [3]. 
Using 
Google 
Earth 
Engine's 
pixel-based 
picture 
categorization, this study gives a dataset for identifying the 
borders of metropolitan areas in India. The authors aim to 
provide a high-quality and reliable dataset for researchers and 
practitioners working towards a profession in urban area 
identification. The dataset was created for the study of 
geographic data and visualization using cloud base platform 
Google Earth Engine. The authors proposed a combination of 
satellite imagery and other data resources to create the dataset, 
and applied a pixel-based image classification algorithm to 
identify urban surroundings. The dataset and the procedures 
used to create it are described in great length in the research, 
and highlights the key features and limitations of the dataset. 
The authors also describe some initial results using the datasets, 
and discuss the potential applications and future directions for 
research using this dataset [4]. 
The research focuses on identifying trends combining satellite 
data and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in emerging 
countries, the density of urban homes is increasing. The goal is 
to create a model that can anticipate events with precision 
housing density in these areas. The authors used satellite 
imagery as input and trained a CNN to recognize patterns and 
structures in the data. As a consequence of the test data, it was 
evident from the findings that the model could correctly 
forecast the density of buildings. The study highlights the 
potential of using CNNs and satellite imagery for analyzing 
urban density of housing in developing countries [5]. 
The categorization of land use in remote sensing pictures is 
done in this article using convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs). The author aims to develop a system that can 
accurately identify and classify different types of land usage in 
satellite images. The system is trained using a large dataset of 
labelled remote sensing images. The performance shows that 
the CNN-based approach outperforms traditional land use 
classification 
methods 
in 
terms 
of 
accuracies 
and 
computational efficiency. The article emphasises the potential 
of CNNs for classifying land use and highlights the necessity 
of having sizable annotated datasets for model training [6]. 
The paper focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNNs) to classify the degree of deprivation in slums areas with 
very high-resolution (VHR) images. The authors aim to 
develop a system that can accurately predict the level of 
deprivation in slums areas based on the characteristics of the 
built environment visible in the photos. The model is trained 
using a dataset of annotated VHR images of slums. The 
outcomes of the study demonstration that the CNN-based 
approach is efficient to accurately predict the degree of 
deprivation in slums based on the features of the built 
environment visible in the images. The paper highlights the 
potential of using CNNs and VHR imagery for understanding 
the characteristics of slums and the level of deprivation 
experienced by the residents [7]. 
The research focuses on employing unsupervised deep learning 
techniques for classification of remote sensing images. To 
effectively categorise remote sensing photos into several land 
cover categories, the authors suggest a new technique for 
unsupervised deep feature extraction. The technique extracts 
feature from the images using an autoencoder network, which 
are subsequently utilised to train a classifier. The study's 
findings demonstrate that the suggested unsupervised deep 
feature extraction method surpasses more established 
techniques for classifying remote sensing images in terms of 
precision and computational efficiency. The promise of 
unsupervised deep learning algorithms for remotely tracking 
picture categorisation is highlighted in the paper, as is the 
significance of feature extraction in this procedure [8]. 
The study classifies building instances using street view 
pictures. The authors want to create a model that can recognise 
and categorise specific buildings in street view pictures. The 
study's findings demonstrate that the suggested approach can 
correctly classify buildings in the test data. The proposed 
approach is trained using a collection of annotated street view 
photos. The research emphasises the value of large annotated 
datasets for training such models as well as the potential of 
employing street view photos for developing instance 
categorization. The authors then go into how the suggested 
approach may be used in a variety of industries, such as real 
estate, disaster response, and urban planning [9]. 
In this study, ML techniques for planning urban land usage are 
reviewed. The authors' goal is to give a summary of the many 
machine learning approaches that have been used to solve 
urban land use planning issues while highlighting their 
advantages and disadvantages. The paper discusses a wide 
range of subjects, including as urban growth projection, land 
use change detection, and examination of urban land usage  
suitability. The authors provide the findings of recent studies in 
this area and talk about the various forms of data and techniques 
employed in these applications. The potential of machine 
learning to solve challenging urban land usage planning issues 
is highlighted in the paper's conclusion, along with the need for 
additional study to increase the precision and effectiveness of 
these algorithms[10]. 
The study focuses on the usage of ANNs and SVMs for picture 
classification. The authors compare how well these two 
machine learning algorithms perform when it comes to picture 
classification tasks. A dataset of photographs is used in the 
study to train and test the models. The findings demonstrate that 
both SVMs and ANNs are effective for picture classification 
and may attain high levels of accuracy, while ANNs typically 
beat SVMs in terms of precision and computational 
effectiveness. The research emphasises the potential of 
employing both SVMs and ANNs for picture classification 
tasks and emphasises how crucial it is to take into account the 
data's properties and the desired outcomes when choosing the 
best machine learning method [11]. 
The paper proposed an overview of the use of machine learning 
in urban spatial analysis. In addition to classifying trends and 
gaps in the field, the authors hope to provide an overview of the 
many machine learning techniques that have been used to solve 
issues in urban settings. The study covers a range of topics, 
including urban land usage planning, urban growth prediction, 
urban land usage change identification, and urban heat island 
analysis. Additionally, the authors suggest areas for future 
research, including the integration of multiple sources of data 
and the use of deep learning techniques [12]. 
In the study , the usage of GIS and RS technologies is 
investigated for the purpose of identifying and analysing 
changes in land use patterns between urban and rural areas. In 
order to track changes in land usage and cover over time, the 
work probably entails gathering and analysing geospatial data, 
such as satellite photography. The results of the research may 
explain the dynamics of urbanisation and its consequences on 
rural environment, agriculture, and other issues [13]. 
High-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are used 
in the technique described in this study to identify floods in both 
urban and rural locations. The suggested technique evaluates 
SAR data from various sources and aims to offer conclusions 
very instantly. The findings demonstrate that the suggested 
strategy may accurately and quickly identify floods in both 
urban and rural locations. The technique has the potential to be 
used in numerous flood early warning and monitoring systems 
[14]. 
In both rural and urban settings, the study analyses how well 
different 
machine 
learning 
algorithms 
perform 
when 
classifying satellite images. According to the findings, 
depending on the region, the algorithms' performance differs, 
with some algorithms performing better in rural than in urban 
settings. Several algorithms were combined to reach the overall 
optimum performance. The study emphasises how crucial it is 
to take into account the environment's unique characteristics 
when choosing a machine learning algorithm for classifying 
satellite images [15]. 
This study suggests a technique for identifying the urban-rural 
border using data from optical and nocturnal lighting. To gather 
data on land usage and land cover, the approach uses both 
optical daytime imaging and night-time light data. The 
suggested approach has the potential to be used in numerous 
applications, including land use planning and monitoring 
urbanisation [16]. 
The technique described in this research uses Markov Random 
Fields (MRF)-based super-resolution mapping to detect urban 
trees in a very high resolution (VHR) photographs. Compared 
to conventional techniques, the MRF model improves tree 
detection accuracy by accounting for the spatial interactions 
between the trees and the structures nearby. The outcomes 
demonstrate that this technique is successful at mapping urban 
trees in VHR photos [17]. 
The research focuses on applying machine learning approaches 
to pinpoint mountainous areas with rural residential land that is 
susceptible to desertion. The study makes use of data to develop 
models that forecast the possibility of land abandonment 
depending on a number of variables, including infrastructure, 
land use, and population density. The findings demonstrate that 
machine learning can be a useful technique for anticipating land 
abandonment in rural areas, giving decision-makers and land 
managers important information to assist solve the problem 
[18]. 
The study explains how to define metropolitan zones using a 
machine learning method. The system precisely locates and 
maps the boundaries of metropolitan regions using satellite 
images and other data sources. The outcomes show how well 
the algorithm defines urban areas precisely, which is important 
for applications like resource management and urban planning. 
The study emphasises how machine learning can be used to 
analyse and comprehend the spatial patterns of urbanisation 
[19]. 
The approach for autonomous navigation described in this 
study uses visual data. The system consists of a visual 
positioning system (VPS) that locates the device in an indoor 
or outdoor area using computer vision techniques. The VPS 
functions by identifying elements in the environment and 
comparing them to a previously created map, which enables the 
device to estimate its position in real-time. The system has 
undergone testing in a variety of indoor and outdoor settings, 
and results in terms of precision and effectiveness have been 
encouraging [20].

METHODOLOGY 
In this study, a model has been constructed for classifying 
urban and rural environments using pictures. The images are 
divided into two groups by the machine learning model. The 
proposed work's whole workflow is depicted in Figure 1, 
starting with data collection, pre-processing of the data, feature 
definition, and feature selection, followed by testing and 
training of the model, which provide the final results. The 
dataset of photos was transformed into feature vectors using a 
computer vision-based method before being given to the 
ML algorithms.

A) About the data set: 
Images from both urban and rural surroundings are collected 
for creating the dataset. Dataset consists total 2000 images, 
1000 of which are of urban regions and 1000 are of rural 
regions. 
 
B) Image Processing: 
The Identification of rural or urban surroundings system used 
three image processing techniques:-  
Resize the photo:  
Resizing is the process of altering an image's size, either 
making it smaller or larger. This is a typical job in image 
processing since it may be used to either reduce the size of huge 
photos or improve the visibility of small ones. Various 
algorithms, such as nearest neighbour, can be used for resizing. 
The aspect ratio must be taken consideration when resizing an 
image to prevent distortion. 
 
   
 
                  
Fig. 2. Images after resizing into 200 x 200 
 
Grayscale to the cropped images:  
Images are represented using shades of grey in the colour space 
known as grayscale. To apply grayscale to an image, its native 
colour space must be changed to grayscale. This method can be 
helpful in image processing since it can lessen the amount of 
information required to represent a picture and facilitate 
processing. When you crop an image, you choose a certain area 
and eliminate the rest.

Edge detection (Prewitt):  
In image processing, edge detection involves locating the 
boundaries between objects in an image. One of several edge 
detection techniques is the Prewitt operator, which determines 
an image's gradient in both the horizontal and vertical 
dimensions. The edge map, which indicates the regions of the 
picture where there are noticeable variations in intensity, may 
then be made by combining the resultant gradients. For 
applications like object recognition, picture segmentation, and 
feature extraction, edge detection is a frequent preprocessing 
step in image processing. 
 
   
 
               
Fig.4.Prewitt Edge detection images 
 
C) Feature Description (BRISK Feature Descriptor): 
A feature descriptor is a mathematical function or algorithm 
that is used to extract information from an image or other type 
of data. In the case of the Identification of rural or urban 
surroundings system, the brisk feature descriptor is used to 
analyze the visual characteristics of the location being 
examined. The brisk feature descriptor is a popular feature 
extraction technique that is used in computer vision 
applications to identify distinctive visual features such as 
corners, edges, and blobs.  
By using the brisk feature descriptor in the Identification of 
rural or urban surroundings system, the system can identify 
specific visual features that are characteristic of rural or urban 
areas. For example, the model may detect that a location is 
rural if it contains more vegetation, fewer buildings, and a 
lower density of population. Alternatively, the system may 
identify that an area is urban if it contains more buildings, 
more roads, and a higher density of population.  
Overall, the use of the brisk feature descriptor in the 
Identification of rural or urban surroundings system helps to 
provide an objective and accurate analysis of a given location 
based on its visual characteristics. 
  
D) Applying K-means Clustering: 
In this clustering algorithm the dataset is grouped into various 
clusters. The value of K should always be odd because if the 
value of K clusters is even then there can be ties in classification 
so to avoid the tie the value must be odd. In this work the K 
value was kept constant and accuracy of all 5 classifiers was 
compared, so that the most efficient value of K could be 
obtained. After comparing the accuracy for all the values of K, 
when K value was 5 Random Forest provided the highest of 
99.72%. So, the value of K Means Cluster is 5. Table.2. shows 
Accuracy of classifiers for value K=5.

KNN 
77.52% 
SVM 
72.01% 
Logistics Regression

E) Training & testing classifiers: 
For every classifier, the dataset must be divided into a 
specific proportion (mostly 70% for training and 30% for 
testing). The same thing is done here, the dataset consists of 
2000 images including rural and urban areas. Out of which the 
model has been trained on 1400 images and has been tested on 
600 images. Proportion for dividing the data into training and 
testing must be proper, if it is not then the accuracy can change 
drastically. (Note: - The training and testing data includes both 
rural and urban areas images) Training data is usually larger 
than testing data because, by doing so models can learn 
meaningful patterns, hence it is necessary to pass a big portion 
of training data for training the model. Once the model is 
trained, it inherits the patterns from the trained data and makes 
predictions on the basis of testing data. To determine the 
accuracy 5 different classifiers are used which provide 5 
different accuracy and later the obtained result is compared.

5) Logistics Regression 
 
Random Forest Algorithm: 
Random forest is a machine learning classifier which is widely 
used when dealing with the problems related to classification. 
As shown in Fig. when the K number of clusters were 5 
Random Forest provided the highest accuracy of 99.79% Fig. 
shows the ROC curve, this curve is a graph which shows the 
performance of the classifier. There are 2 parameters plotted on 
the curve.  
 
 
 
 
Fig.5.  ROC curve provided by Random Forest Algorithm 
 
Decision Tree Classifier: 
Decision Tree is a classifier which comprises nodes. It has a 
tree-like structure and on the basis of impurity it determines 
where the next node should go. Further the tree is divided into 
internal nodes and branches. A decision tree is a method used 
for classification and prediction. It is a tree-like structure that 
represents different possible outcomes or decisions based on 
certain input conditions. The tree branches out based on 
specific conditions or rules, and each branch leads to a specific 
outcome or decision. The root node represents the initial input, 
while the leaf nodes represent the final decision. It’s commonly 
used in machine learning, operations research, and decision 
making. Decision Tree Classifier provided the accuracy of 
82.91%. 
 
K Nearest Neighbour (KNN): 
The simplest machine learning technique. In this algorithm K 
number of neighbors are selected and then distance of K nearest 
neighbors is calculated. Then the neighbors which are nearest 
are taken according to their particular Euclidean distance. Then 
the classifier is ready. The main advantage of KNN is its 
simplicity and flexibility, however, it can be computationally 
expensive for large datasets. KNN Classifier provided the 
accuracy of 98.92%. 
 
SVM: 
SVM is a well-known technique in supervised learning, 
which can be used for categorisation and regression problems. 
However, it is commonly employed for classification problems 
in machine learning. The primary objective of the SVM 
algorithm is to identify the optimal line or decision boundary in 
n-dimensional space, enabling us to classify new data points 
into the appropriate category in the future. Here the Linear 
kernel is used which provides 73.20% accuracy in predicting 
the classification of new data points. 
 
Logistics Regression: 
It is a data analysis approach that uses mathematics to 
determine the correlations between two data variables. The 
connection is then used to forecast the value of one of the 
parameters depending on the other. Predictions often have a 
limited number of outcomes, such as yes or no. when liblinear 
solver is used it gives accuracy 59.01%. 
 
F) K-Fold Cross Validation: 
It divides the dataset into K numbers/samples of groups into the 
same size. These are known as folds. Here the different 
prediction function k folds are used for the learning set and the 
remaining folds are used for the test set. In this work the K 
value is 3. After comparing the average accuracy for all the 
values of K, when K value was 5 Random Forest provided the 
highest of 99.82%. So, the value of K in K-Fold is 3. Table.3. 
shows average accuracy of different classifiers using k-fold 
with k value 5.

VI. 
Conclusion and Future Scope 
Urban and Rural identification is a challenging problem 
because there is no clear identification line between two areas. 
Here, we presented an approach for identifying rural and urban 
areas, which tended to result in identification maps that were 
more useful. With this method, it would be possible to classify 
each building's land use with comparatively high accuracy. The 
images dataset was provided to various machine learning 
classifiers, including SVM, RF, Logistics regression, Decision 
Tree, KNN, etc. The results indicates that BRISK is a better 
feature extraction approach for feature vectors to be extracted 
for this specific research, with Random Forest giving the 
highest accuracy of 99.79%. For further work, more data may 
be included to enhance classification performance, such as text 
descriptions attached to social media photographs and brand 
names and other text information that appears in photos.
